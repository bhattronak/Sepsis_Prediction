# Sepsis_Prediction
Sepsis is a serious medical condition that requires early detection and prediction to improve patient outcomes. Machine learning can be used to analyze patient data and identify patterns to predict sepsis. A sepsis prediction project aims to develop a machine learning-based system to monitor patients and identify those at risk of developing sepsis. The goal is to improve patient outcomes and reduce sepsis-related deaths.
